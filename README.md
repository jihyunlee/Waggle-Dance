Waggle-Dance
============
This project is about the waggle dance of the honeybeeÂ that shows his colony where food source is and how abundant and quality it is.

In general, honeybees do not travel as a group. They communicate and learn from each other through how they dance. The dance contains information about direction and distance of food source. How intelligent they are! For reference, take a look at this <a href="http://youtu.be/bFDGPgXtK-U?t=4m10s" target="_blank">video</a>.

The Waggle Dance is an interactive learning for kids to teach themselves how a honeybee performs waggle dance depending on where they place a flower.
